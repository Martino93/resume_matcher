TF-IDF (Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency) is a feature that associates a number with each word in a document to represent its relevance. TF-IDF has two parts: 

- Term Frequency (TF): Indicates the frequency of each word in the document or dataset.

- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Tells us how important the word is to the document.

Cosine similarity is a metric that measures the similarity between two vectors. It's often used in text analysis to measure document similarity.

This project is an exercise to use natural language concepts to return a similarity score between job descriptions and resumes.
